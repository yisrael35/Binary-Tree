explaintion:
The program receives numbers and bulild a binary tree, and store each tree in an array of trees,
and also can print the tree, or do a mirror to a tree, or check is highet, or print the smallest value, or check if its binary search tree,
or check if two trees are the same


to compile:
press ctrl +shift+b

to run the program: 
press ctrl+f5

the files of the program: 
Ex4.cpp , Btree.cpp , Btree.h

input:
The program receives numbers in the following format:
"to set a tree enter 'a number of tree' '0' "
"to set a new head in the tree enter 'a number of tree' '1' 'value'"
"to print the smallest value in the tree enter 'num of tree' '2'"
"to know if its binary search tree enter 'num of tree' '4'"
"to know the depth of the tree enter 'num of tree' '5'"
"to to do a mirror to a tree enter 'num of tree' '6' "
"to know if the trees are same enter 'num of tree' '7' 'second tree'"
"to print a tree enter 'num of tree' '9' "
"enter -1 to exit ".

output: 
(in case of  '2')
print the smallest value
(in case of '4')
print 1 if it is a binary tree and 0 if its not
(in case of  '5')
print the max depth of the tree
(in case of  '7')
print 1 if the trees are the same and 0 if its not
(in case of print '9')
the tree will be printed in mathod of inorder.
